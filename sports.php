    <div class="block"><center><h1>CRICKET</h1></center>
        <p><h3>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 20-metre (22-yard)
         pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball
          bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player 
          (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails,
           and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground. When ten players have been
            dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match
             referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.
        
              There are various formats ranging from Twenty20, played over a few hours with each team batting for a single
             innings of 20 overs,
             to Test matches, played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams each batting for two innings of unlimited length. 
             Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the
              basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of
               compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core which is layered with tightly wound string.</h3></p>

    <div class="block"><center><h1>FOOTBALL</h1></center>
           <h3> Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football
             normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include 
             association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football);
              Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football.[1][2] These various forms of
               football are known as football codes.

            There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.
            [3][4][5] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the
             nineteenth century.[6][7] The expansion of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British 
             influence outside the directly controlled Empire.[8] By the end of the nineteenth century, distinct regional codes were already 
             developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order
              to maintain their heritage.
            [9] In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions.
             During the twentieth century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in 
             the world.[10]</h3>

    <div class="block"><center><h1>HOCKEY</h1></center>
            <h3>The first recorded use of the word hockey is in the 1773 book Juvenile Sports and Pastimes, to Which Are Prefixed, Memoirs of the Author: Including a New Mode of Infant Education by Richard Johnson (Pseud. Master Michel Angelo), whose chapter XI was titled "New Improvements on the Game of Hockey".[2] The belief that hockey was mentioned in a 1363 proclamation by King Edward III of England[3] is based on modern translations of the proclamation, which was originally in Latin and explicitly forbade the games "Pilam Manualem, Pedivam, & Bacularem: & ad Canibucam & Gallorum Pugnam".[4][5] The English historian and biographer John Strype did not use the word "hockey" when he translated the proclamation in 1720, instead translating "Canibucam" as "Cambuck";[6] this may have referred to either an early form of hockey or a game more similar to golf or croquet.[7]

            The word hockey itself is of unknown origin. One supposition is that it is a derivative of hoquet, a Middle French word for a shepherd's stave.[8] The curved, or "hooked" ends of the sticks used for hockey would indeed have resembled these staves. Another supposition derives from the known use of cork bungs, (stoppers) in place of wooden balls to play the game. The stoppers came from barrels containing "hock" ale, also called "hocky".[9]
            
            History</h3>

    <div class="block"><center><h1>BADMINTON</h1></center>
           <h3>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.

            Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.[1]
            
            The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.
            
            The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock.
             European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent
              competitions dominated by China. Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles,
               women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles,[2] with mixed doubles added four years later. At high levels of play,
                the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a
                 technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.[3]</h3>
