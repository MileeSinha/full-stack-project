        <p><h3>
                Clothing in India changes depending on the different ethnicity, geography, climate, and cultural traditions of the people of each region 
                of India. Historically, male and female clothing has evolved from simple garments like kaupina, langota, dhoti, lungi, sari, gamcha, and 
                loincloths to cover the body into elaborate costumes not only used in daily wear, but also on festive occasions, as well as rituals and
                 dance performances. In urban areas, western clothing is common and uniformly worn by people of all social levels. India also has a great 
                 diversity [1] in terms of weaves, fibers, colours, and material of clothing. Sometimes, color codes are followed in clothing based on the
                  religion and ritual concerned. The clothing in India also encompasses the wide variety of Indian embroidery, prints,
                 handwork, embellishment, styles of wearing cloths. A wide mix of Indian traditional clothing and western styles can be seen in India.

    <div class="block"><center><h1>WESTREN WEAR</h1></center>
           <h3> 
                Western wear is a category of men's and women's clothing which derives its unique style from the clothes worn in the 19th century Wild West. It ranges from accurate historical reproductions of pioneer, mountain man, Civil War, cowboy and vaquero clothing to the stylized garments popularized by singing cowboys such as Gene Autry and Roy Rogers in the 1940s and 1950s. Western wear can be very informal, with a t-shirt and blue jeans forming a basic ensemble, or it may consist of tailored formal garments with western accents. 
                At minimum, western wear generally incorporates a cowboy hat, a leather belt, and cowboy boots.

                    In the 1960s and 1970s, at the same time as Western fashion was adopting elements of Indian dress, Indian fashion also absorbed elements of Western dress.[2][3] This practice of mutual appropriation continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, as multiculturalism in fashion design took hold, with Western designers incorporating traditional Indian crafts, textiles and techniques at the same time as Indian designers allowed the West to influence their work.[2] While middle-class Indian women in migrant communities originally tended to favour Western styles for all occasions in the 1960s and 1970s, they gradually began to wear stylish Indian dress for special occasions as a status symbol equivalent to chic Western fashion.[4] One example of a traditionally Indian garment that has been heavily influenced by Western fashion is the kurta suit, a reversal of the established tradition of Western fashion being influenced by Asian design.[3] Geczy noted that an Indian woman wearing traditional clothing might find herself
                    
                     said to be "imitating" Western fashion, and that the boundaries between East and West in fashion were becoming increasingly blurred.[3]

    <div class="block"><center><h1>JAPANESE WEAR</h1></center>
           <h3>
                There are typically two types of clothing that the Japanese wear: the Japanese clothing (和服 wafuku), such as kimonos, and Western clothing (洋服 yōfuku). Japanese traditional fashion combines multiple styles that reflect early Japan's visual culture. It represents the culture's visible artistic and traditional values and joins them together to create a form of fashion recognizable to foreign cultures. The most well known form of Japanese traditional fashion is the kimono (translates to "something to wear"),[1] but other types include the yukata and the hakama.[2] The different styles have been produced, expressed, and transformed by artists well known in Japan, including fashion designers Issey Miyake , Yohji Yamamoto, and Rei Kawakubo. Their works have influenced numerous designers outside of the country that showcase their designs in fashion shows exposed internationally.[3] From the intricate patterns to the layers of fabric, the essence of beauty that was found in traditional wear
                 has influenced the modern fashion that is immersed in Japan's community on a daily basis, specially found in Tokyo, the capital of Japan.[4]
